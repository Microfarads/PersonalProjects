# Data Science portfolio by Eric Wu

This is a repository of my personal projects involving data analysis, visualization, and testing machine learning algorithms.

### [EDA of Geotab Intersection Congestion Data](https://github.com/Microfarads/PersonalProjects/blob/master/Geotab_EDA%2BModeling.ipynb)
This is an exploratory data analysis of traffic data collected by Geotab at various intersections throughout the cities of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.  In this analysis, I explore the distributions of average stop time percentiles and investigate their dependence on variables such as direction turned, angle of turn, time of day, etc.  I also perform some modeling in attempts to predict stop times and compare performance between a simple linear regression model and a more modern gradient-booosting based algorithm, lightGBM.
