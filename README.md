This is a repository of my personal projects involving data analysis, visualization, and testing machine learning algorithms.

### EDA of BigQuery-Geotab Intersection Congestion
This is an exploratory data analysis of traffic data collected by Geotab at various intersections throughout the cities of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.  In this analysis, I explore the distributions of average stop time percentiles and investigate their dependence on variables such as direction turned, angle of turn, time of day, etc.  I also perform some modeling in attempts to predict stop time percentiles etc., comparing performance between simple linear regression and a more modern gradient-booosting based algorithm, lightGBM.
